The task: Choose one proof-based problem (i.e. a problem whose statement includes the words prove or show that) from the text Linear Algebra Done Right, 3rd edition, Chapter 1 or Chapter 2. Solve and submit.
Instructions:

1. The assignment is to be done in groups. A group may consist of as many students as you like (1 person groups are also fine).


2. If the submissions indicate that there has been discussion among two or more separate groups, those submissions will be automatically awarded a zero. Please note that this has nothing to do with the institute's Plagiarism Policy. The institute allows discussion between students on assignments. However, in the real world, if members of one group of collaborators decide to send their results for publication separately, it is considered unethical. Therefore if you collaborate on solving a problem with any other student, all collaborators must submit their work as one group. Your final submission should include a list of names of all collaborators. If I see multiple submissions that do not adhere to this, I will award a zero. No excuses will be entertained.


3. If any of you is quoting problem numbers from an edition different from the 3rd edition, please indicate that in your comment.

4. If a group has four or more collaborators, we may randomly select one student from your group and ask him/her to present the work, before the group is assigned a grade.
