Proofs Assignment - Not for marks
Select a problem from the Chapter 1 or Chapter 2A of the Axler's ``Linear Algebra Done Right'' and be prepared to present it.

Once you have selected a problem and worked out a solution, you may submit a draft that you wish to present. I will look at the drafts that are posted and will suggest modifictaions if necessary.


You also need to post your intention to present a problem as a public comment to this thread, so that other students do not duplicate your effort.

I will schedule a presentation as soon as 10 acceptable drafts have been submitted.

If you find a problem interesting and would like a hint on solving it, you can post a public comment about that as well.

Please note that this assignment does not carry any marks or weightage and should, ideally, in no way influence your grade in the course.
